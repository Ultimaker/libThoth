Thoth is an ancient Egyptian god. In this mythology he was seen as the originator of order. He was known also as the first being who could measure, and therefore is identified with Geometry or Mathematics. Thoth is sometimes called also "The measurer of this earth". He is said to have "calculated the earth and counted the things which are in it".
